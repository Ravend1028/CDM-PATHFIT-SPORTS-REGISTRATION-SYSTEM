# CDM-PATHFIT-SPORTS-REGISTRATION-SYSTEM
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the commissioned website project I developed for the junior year students at my university. As a senior in my fourth year of study, I took on this project as part of their curriculum for the Software Design course. Commissioned with the task, I utilized Bootstrap for frontend design, JavaScript for interactivity, and PHP with MySQL for backend functionalities, resulting in a comprehensive full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency and knowledge gained throughout my academic journey but also serves as a valuable contribution to the educational experience of junior students.
